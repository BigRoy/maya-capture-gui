_Currently this is a initial commit to open discussion about overall
implementation.  
As such, consider this experimental and not fit for production
yet._

### Usage

Take control over your Maya playblast. Become the boss over the settings like
resolutions, nodes to show and anything related to the view. While managing
your settings instantly see what your playblast will look like, WYSIWYG.

For `capture_gui` to work you'll need to have `capture` installed, which you
can get [here](https://github.com/abstractfactory/maya-capture).
